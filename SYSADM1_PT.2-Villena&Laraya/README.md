## Key Features  

### **1. Scalability Enhancements**  
- **EtherChannel Technology**: Combines multiple uplinks between core and access switches to boost bandwidth and support growing traffic demands.  
- **Load Balancers**: Efficiently distribute workloads across servers to prevent bottlenecks during peak periods.  
- **Cloud Integration**: Migrates critical applications to a cloud platform, offering elastic scalability and automated backups.  

### **2. Security Upgrades**  
- **Cisco TrustSec**: Implements identity-based access control and segmentation for enhanced security.  
- **Secure Group Tags (SGTs)**: Enables dynamic traffic segmentation and policy enforcement based on user and device roles.  
- **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)**: Centralized identity and access control system for managing user policies.  
- **VPN Integration**: Ensures encrypted and secure remote access for employees and partners.  
- **Firewalls with Advanced Threat Protection**: Protects against DDoS attacks and provides real-time threat mitigation.  

### **3. Redundancy and Reliability**  
- **Triple ISP Connection**: Ensures continuous uptime with automatic failover in case of ISP outages.  
- **Core Switch Redundancy**: Eliminates single points of failure in critical network layers.  
- **Monitoring Tools**: Uses SolarWinds and Nagios for real-time network insights and proactive issue management.

## Implementation Plan  

### **Phase 1: Core and Access Layer Upgrades**  
- Deploy high-performance switches and configure VLAN trunking.  
- Implement EtherChannel for bandwidth aggregation.  
- Cost Estimate: ₱300,000 to ₱450,000.  

### **Phase 2: DMZ and Security Enhancements**  
- Install load balancers, configure dual firewalls, and deploy intrusion prevention systems (IPS).  
- Implement VPN for remote access.  
- Cost Estimate: ₱350,000 to ₱450,000.  

### **Phase 3: Cloud Migration and Testing**  
- Migrate key services to cloud platforms with automated backups.  
- Conduct system-wide redundancy and scalability tests.  
- Cost Estimate: ₱200,000 to ₱300,000.
