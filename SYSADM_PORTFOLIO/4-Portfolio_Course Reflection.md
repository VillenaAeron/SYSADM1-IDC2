**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

|My initial expectations for this course are for me to learn more about system administration and that I can apply my learnings from the pre-requisite course. I also expect that this course will teach me more about systems, and how to perform monitoring and administration. The course met my expectations and I could fully grasp the main topics. It also exceeded my expectations in midterms since that was when I needed to use my learning and understanding. |
| :- |

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

|The main topics or concepts covered in the course are policies, risk assessment and planning, company agreements, system monitoring, utilizing Linux for Administration, and using some terminals like Git. These topics deepened and enhanced my understanding and learning about the various topics. It requires me to use my logical thinking, my own learnings, and observational skills to fully grasp the subject matter. |

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course material?

|As I reflect on my learning process, the most effective strategies and techniques that helped me grasp and retain the course materials are redoing the activities, using notes, utilizing AI for summarizing topics, using analogies, and collaborative learning. These were my strategies and techniques for better grasping the topics and retaining my learning. |
| :- |

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they effective?

|The Laboratory Activities about Linux and Windows, the making of a EULA, and the collaborative activity are the particular activities that significantly enhance my learning experience. These activities tested my learnings and understanding about the activities, some activities I'm just aware of like the EULA and collaborative activity about servers and I didn't know what to do which forced me to apply what I understood. The Laboratory work enhances my skills and understanding of how to administer the two OS, jogging my learnings about servers, and that they are being executed in a virtual machine instead of an individual machine.|
| :- |

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

|There are some challenges and difficulties like when troubleshooting our activity in Linux and adding a Virtual Printer in a VM box. These activities tested my learnings and experience as they're new to me to experience. I first tried to troubleshoot it on my own and observe the error, backtracking my steps to ensure that there weren't any misconfigurations, and trying solutions or methods that I previously knew. If I checked it all and I still have some trouble, that will be the time on which I will search the web for an answer. I learn from my first experience and handle my problem and used my problem-solving skills and logical thinking to answer my problem, that is experience is the best teacher when it comes to overcoming my obstacles. |
| :- |

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or decision-making?

|The course highly encourages us to be critical thinkers and use our analysis. The activities that our instructor gave us requires us to make a smart decision- making like for creating our policies and Assessing the needs for our company, promoting problem-solving in our Laboratory Activities as we also encounter some errors when doing them, and higher-order thinking skills as we also think outside the box and not only depend on what they thought us. |
| :- |

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or perspectives did you gain from this course?

|Reflecting on my personal growth, this course enhanced my knowledge about System and also Server Administration, it taught me new knowledge specially regarding to the Linux OS and put me in different perspective which I experienced which can be helpful in the future. It also enhanced my problem solving skills and decision-making with the activities given to me. It also piqued my interest more in taking the path of System Administration as I am eager to learn more on how to handle the systems in an organization. |
| :- |

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your future studies, career, or personal life?

|I plan to apply my learnings in this course to my future studies, career, or personal life by continuing my studies when I start getting my Masters Degree in IT, teaching it to others, and I can utilize this learnings for my Thesis. I will expound my learnings in myself and start exploring more about System Administration. This subject course might make me turn a 360 degree in my original path, which can be mysterious but exciting.    |
